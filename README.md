This project aims to classify news articles as fake or real using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. It covers:

Data cleaning & preprocessing: Removing punctuation, stopwords, and applying stemming.

Text vectorization: Using techniques like TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical format.

Model building: Training classification models such as Logistic Regression, PassiveAggressiveClassifier, and others.

Performance evaluation: Assessing models with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Real-world utility: Can be integrated into browser extensions or media platforms to flag suspicious news content.

ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
